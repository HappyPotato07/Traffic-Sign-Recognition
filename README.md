# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
This project focuses on Traffic Sign Recognition using deep learning techniques, aiming to improve safety in autonomous vehicles and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). The project utilizes the GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark Dataset, which contains over 51,000 images across 43 traffic sign classes. The dataset reflects real-world conditions such as varying lighting, weather, and viewing angles, making it ideal for training robust models.  The implementation includes three distinct deep learning architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Each model is evaluated for its effectiveness in recognizing traffic signs. CNNs excel at learning spatial hierarchies in images, achieving a validation accuracy of 97%. LSTMs capture temporal dependencies, reaching a validation accuracy of 97.89%. RNNs, including architectures like Vanilla RNN and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), are employed to analyze sequence data with impressive performance metrics.  The project applies various preprocessing techniques to prepare the dataset for training. These include image normalization, data augmentation (such as random rotation, zoom, and shifts), and label encoding. Special attention is given to addressing class imbalances to ensure the models perform well across all traffic sign categories. The dataset is further enriched with metadata that includes information about each sign's class, shape, and color, aiding in better feature extraction.  Key evaluation metrics, including accuracy, loss, confusion matrices, and classification reports, demonstrate the models' effectiveness. All models achieve over 95% accuracy, with CNNs and LSTMs showing exceptional performance. Early stopping and hyperparameter tuning are employed to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting.  To replicate this project, Python 3.7+ is required along with libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. After cloning the repository, dependencies can be installed, and the GTSRB dataset can be placed in the specified directory. The preprocessing, training, and evaluation scripts are easy to use, allowing users to experiment with different models and parameters.  This project highlights the potential of deep learning in real-world applications like traffic sign recognition, contributing to safer autonomous driving systems.
